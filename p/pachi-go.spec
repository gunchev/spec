%description
Pachi is a reasonably strong engine for the ancient game of go.
(https://senseis.xmp.net/?Go)

The default engine plays by Chinese rules and should be about 7d KGS
strength on 9x9. On 19x19 it can hold a solid KGS 2d rank on modest
hardware (Raspberry Pi 3, dcnn) or faster machine (e.g. six-way Intel
i7) without dcnn. When using a large cluster (64 machines, 20 cores each),
it maintains KGS 3d to 4d and has won e.g. a 7-stone handicap game against
Zhou Junxun 9p.

By default, Pachi currently uses the UCT engine that combines Monte Carlo
approach with tree search; UCB1AMAF tree policy using the RAVE method is
used for tree search, while the Moggy playout policy using 3Ã—3 patterns
and various tactical checks is used for the semi-random Monte Carlo
playouts. Large-scale board patterns and dcnn are used in the tree
search. Technical information (only slightly dated) about Pachi's
architecture and algorithms can be found in Petr Baudis' Master's Thesis:
