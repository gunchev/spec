%description
Identify content management systems (CMS), blogging platforms, stats/analytics
packages, javascript libraries, servers and more. When you visit a website in 
your browser the transaction includes many unseen hints about how the webserver
is set up and what software is delivering the webpage. Some of these hints
are obvious, eg. "Powered by XYZ" and others are more subtle.
WhatWeb recognises these cues and reports what it finds.
